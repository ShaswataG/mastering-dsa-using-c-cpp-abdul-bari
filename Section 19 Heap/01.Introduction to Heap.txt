Conditions for a heap:
    i) it is a complete binary Tree or almost complete binary tree
    ii) it can have either of the two possibilities- max heap & min heap

Note- i) heaps are represented using array
      ii) since heap is a complete binary tree, its height = log(n)
      iii) heap is not used for searching purpose

Max heap- every node should have an element greater than or equal to all its descendants (duplicates are also allowed unlike BST)
Min heap- every node should have an element smaller than or equal to all its descendants
