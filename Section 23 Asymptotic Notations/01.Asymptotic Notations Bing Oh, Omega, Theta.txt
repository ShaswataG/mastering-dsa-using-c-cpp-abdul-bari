1 < logn < n < nlogn < n^2 < n^3 < ..... < 2^n < 3^n < 4^n < ... < n^n

Polynomial TC = 1, logn, n, nlogn, n^2, n^3
Exponential TC = 2^n, 3^n, 4^n .... n^n

the order is valid for large values of n
Ex: if n = 2, n^3 = 8 whereas 2^2 = 4, order is not followed
    if n = 10, n^3 = 1000 whereas 2^10 = 1024, order is followed

Conclusion: From some value of n, the order is followed

Lower bound: omega(Ω)
Upper bound: Big Oh(O)
Tight bound: theta(Θ)

We use the above notations, when its difficult or not possible to find the exact polynomial or formula for functions
Ex: for the time function ∑ni=1 i*2^i, instead of evaluating it, we can write it as O(n2^n) or Ω(2)

When we can evaluate the exact time function, we use theta(Θ)
