m-ary tree- every node in the tree can have atmost m children

For 3-ary tree
    Its not necessary for any node to have 3 children, even a binary tree can be called a 3-ary tree as, its highest degree is less than 3
    What matters is the maximum capacity of children of a node, which is 3 in this case
    Given, height = h
        minimum no. of nodes = 3h+1
        maximum no. of nodes = (3^(h+1)-1)/2
    Given, no. of nodes = n
        maximum height = (n-1)/3
        minimum height = log3[3n+1]-1

Degree of m-ary tree = {0, 1, 2, ... m}
ex- degree 3-ary tree = {0, 1, 2, 3}

Strict m-ary tree- every node can have either 0 or exactly m children

For Strict m-ary tree,
    Given, height = h
        minimum no. of nodes = mh+1
        maximum no. of nodes = (m^(h+1)-1)/(m-1)
    Given, no. of nodes = n
        maximum height = (n-1)/m
        minimum height = logm[n(m-1)+1]-1
    Relationship b/w no. of internal and external nodes is given by-
        e=(m-1)i+1
        where, e = no. of external nodes
               i = no. of internal nodes
