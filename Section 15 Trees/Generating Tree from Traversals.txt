If any one traverasal (preorder/postorder/inorder/levelorder) is given, no. of trees that can be generated = 2nCn/(n+1)   (catalan no.)

If both preorder and postorder are given, more than one binary trees are possible (not a catalan no.)

If either (preorder+inorder) or (postorder+inorder) are given, then a single tree can be generated

For generating a tree-
    Any two traverals must be known
    Out ot that, one of the traversal must be inorder
