Array representation
it can be static as well as dynamic
             A
           /   \
         B       C
       /  \     /  \
     D      E  F     G

    A B C D E F G
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7

    Let element be at index i
    index of left child = 2*i
    index of right child = (2*i)+1
    index of parent = floor(i/2)

Linked representation
it is always dynamic
we don't call it Linked list represetation, because list means linear but tree is non linear data structure
For any shape of binary tree, represented using linked representation,
number of null pointers = n (where n = number of nodes)
