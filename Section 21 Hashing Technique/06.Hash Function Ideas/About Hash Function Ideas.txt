Properties of Hash Function:
    i)  keys in a hash table should be uniformly distributed, they shouldn't be concentrated at the same place (to avoid collision)
    ii) it should give the same index every time (while storing and searching)

while designing a hash function:
    i)  based on key values
    ii) requirement

chaining, size of hash table can be anything
linear probing, size of hash table must be twice of number of keys
