hash function, h(x) = x%size
probe function, h'(x) = (h(x)+f(i))
    where, f(i) = i^2
           i = 0, 1, 2, 3...

Loading factor, λ = n/size      
    where, n = no. of keys
           s = size of hash table

for probing, λ <= 0.5 (must)    (no. of keys inserted should not be more than half of size of hash table)

Avg. successful search, t = -loge(1-λ)/λ
Avg. unsuccesful search, t = 1/(1-λ)

Advantage of Quadratic probing over Linear probing:
    i)  Avoids clustering of keys, stores keys far from each other, saves unnecessary comparison of keys while searching
