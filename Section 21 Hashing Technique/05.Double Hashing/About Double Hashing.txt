two hash functions present

second hash function should have two desired properties:
    i)  it never gives the index 0
    ii) it should try to probe all locations (such that all the locations are utilized)

Double hashing reduces collision

Let,
h1(x) = x%10    (regular hash function)
h2(x) = R - (s%R)   or we can consider any other hash function also
h'(x) = (h1(x)+i*h2(x))%10      (modified hash function) 
    where, i = 0, 1, 2, 3....
