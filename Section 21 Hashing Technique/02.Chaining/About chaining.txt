each index in hashh table (array) can store a pointer to a node
hash function is decided by programmer based on given data, it is subjective

suppose hash function is given by- h(x) = x%10
    hash table is of size 10, suppose we need to search 23
    h(23) = 23%10 = 3
    Hash[23] stores the pointer to a chain of elements with 2 at unit's digit

loading factor (lamda) = n/size
    where, n = no. of elements
           size = size of hash table

average successful search = 1+(lamda/2)
average unsuccessful search = 1+lamda
