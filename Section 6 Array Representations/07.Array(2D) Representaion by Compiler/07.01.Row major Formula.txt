Row major formula or representation of 2D array
elements of the 2D-array are mapped on a 1D-array row by row
left to right (i -> j)

Let's assume a 2D-array a[m][n] (array with m rows, n columns)

for indexing starting from 0
Add(a[i][j]) = L + (i * n + j) * w
where,
    L = base address
    i = row index
    j = column index
    n = number of columns
    w = size of data type

for indexing starting from 1
Add(a[i][j]) = L + {(i - 1) * n + (j - 1)} * w
where,
    L = base address
    i = row index
    j = column index
    n = number of columns
    w = size of data type

indexing starts from 0 in C/C++ because of less number of operations in formula as observed above
