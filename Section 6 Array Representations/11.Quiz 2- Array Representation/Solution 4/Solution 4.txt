type x[l][m][n]
Add(x[i][j][k]) = L + (i*m*n + j*n + k)*w
                = L + i*m*n*w + j*n*w + k*w

k * w = t2
=> k * w = k * 4
=> w = 4

j*n*w = t1
=> j * n * w = j * 32
=> n * w = 32
=> n = 8 (since w = 4)

i * m * n * w = t0
=> i * m * 8 * 4 = i * 1024
=> m  = 1024/(8 * 4)
=> m = 32

Therefore, m = 32, n = 8, w = 4

float x[?][32][8] matches with option (b) i.e. float x[12][32][8]
Therefore, (b) is the correct option
